# Ubuntu textmining binaries

Ubuntu compiled binaries for Python textmining in support of a Heroku buildpack.

# About

These packages were compiled on a virtual machine that matched Heroku's
runtime environment (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) for Python runtime 3.4.3.

This project also includes the tarball `npscipy.tar.gz`, which contains libraries 
for BLAS, LAPACK, ATLAS, and Fortran, which are needed by NumPy and SciPy at 
runtime.

For older binaries, please take a look at https://github.com/dbrgn/npscipy-binaries
